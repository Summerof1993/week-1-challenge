# Week-1-challenge

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to update the code of a website to make it more accessible. Accessibility is important in order to provide a better experience for all the users and helps create a fair and inclusive space for all. During this project, I was able to learn how to leverage semantic tags to give the HTML document a better structure that is independent of layout or styling. I also updated the CSS code and refactored it using the DRY methodology.
